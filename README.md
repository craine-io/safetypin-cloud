# SafetyPin Cloud

SafetyPin Cloud is a secure file transfer solution that enables clients to transfer files to Amazon S3 buckets through ephemeral SFTP connections without requiring them to maintain their own servers.

## What is SafetyPin Cloud?

SafetyPin Cloud helps you:
- Create ephemeral SFTP connections that route directly to S3 buckets
- Provide secure file transfer capabilities to clients without AWS knowledge
- Keep track of all file transfers and access attempts
- Manage connections with granular security controls and expiration dates
- Store and organize transferred files in your own S3 buckets

## Project Structure

The project has three main parts:

```
safetypin-cloud/
â”œâ”€â”€ safetypin-frontend/     # The web interface
â”œâ”€â”€ safetypin-backend/      # The server code that runs in AWS
â””â”€â”€ safetypin-infrastructure/ # The code that sets up AWS resources
```

### Setting Up the Frontend

1. Go to the frontend folder:
   ```
   cd safetypin-frontend
   ```

2. Install the packages:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:3000

### Fixing Git Line Ending Issues

If you encounter warnings about line endings (LF vs. CRLF), follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the correct Git configuration files:
   ```
   # Check if the files exist at the root of the repository
   ls -la .gitattributes .gitignore
   ```

2. If needed, remove node_modules from Git tracking:
   ```
   git rm -r --cached safetypin-frontend/node_modules
   ```

3. Add and commit the Git configuration files:
   ```
   git add .gitattributes .gitignore
   git commit -m "Add Git configuration files"
   ```

4. For new projects, consider configuring Git line endings:
   ```
   # For Windows:
   git config --global core.autocrlf true
   
   # For Mac/Linux:
   git config --global core.autocrlf input
   ```
