# SafetyPin Cloud

SafetyPin is a secure file transfer solution that enables users to create ephemeral SFTP connections that route directly to Amazon S3 buckets. The application provides a user-friendly web interface for managing these connections without requiring clients to have AWS knowledge or maintain their own servers.

## Project Status

SafetyPin is currently in active development. The OSS Edition is being developed with core functionality implemented first, followed by commercial features. The following components are in development:

- âœ… **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL schema design, migration system, and repository implementations complete
- âœ… **Development Environment**: Docker containerization for easy local development
- âœ… **Basic Backend API**: Core Express server setup with middleware and error handling
- âœ… **Frontend-Backend Integration**: API service and testing components in place
- ðŸš§ **Authentication Services**: In-progress implementation of user management, auth, SSO, and MFA
- ðŸš§ **API Implementation**: In-progress development of REST endpoints for core functionality
- ðŸš§ **Cloud Integration**: Upcoming work on AWS, Azure, and GCP integrations
- ðŸš§ **Frontend UI Components**: In-progress development of authentication and server management UI

See the [Project Todos](./docs/project-todos.md) file for a detailed breakdown of completed and pending tasks.

## What is SafetyPin?

SafetyPin helps you:
- Create ephemeral SFTP connections that route directly to S3 buckets
- Provide secure file transfer capabilities to clients without AWS knowledge
- Keep track of all file transfers and access attempts
- Manage connections with granular security controls and expiration dates
- Store and organize transferred files in your own S3 buckets

## Architecture

The application follows a three-tier architecture:

1. **Frontend (safetypin-frontend)**:
   - Built with React.js and TypeScript
   - Uses Material-UI (MUI) for the UI components
   - AWS Amplify for authentication and API integration
   - React Router for navigation
   - Axios for API requests

2. **Backend (safetypin-backend)**:
   - Serverless architecture using AWS Lambda functions
   - Organized into functional areas (auth, billing, files, servers)
   - Node.js runtime
   - PostgreSQL database for HIPAA compliance
   - Repository pattern for data access

3. **Infrastructure (safetypin-infrastructure)**:
   - AWS CDK for infrastructure as code
   - Multiple infrastructure stacks:
     - API Stack
     - Authentication Stack
     - Database Stack
     - Frontend Stack
     - Monitoring Stack
     - SFTP Stack (AWS Transfer Family)

```

## Database Design

SafetyPin uses PostgreSQL as the primary database for HIPAA compliance. The database design follows these principles:

- Schema with comprehensive tables for users, organizations, servers, files, and more
- Encryption utilities for sensitive data using industry-standard algorithms
- Migration system with version control for seamless upgrades
- Repository pattern implementation providing a clean abstraction over data access

Each repository implements a TypeScript interface that defines its capabilities, making it easy to create mocks for testing or switch implementations if needed.

## Getting Started with Docker

The easiest way to run SafetyPin locally is using Docker Compose:

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine
- Git

### Running the Development Environment

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/safetypin-cloud.git
   cd safetypin-cloud
   ```

2. Start the development environment:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   docker-up.bat
   
   # Linux/Mac
   ./docker-up.sh
   ```
   
   Alternatively:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
   ```

3. Access the application:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3001 (maps to port 3000 on the container)
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3000
   - PostgreSQL: localhost:5432

4. Development:
   - The frontend and backend source directories are mounted as volumes
   - Changes will be automatically reloaded
   - When running in Docker, the frontend communicates with the backend using the internal Docker service name: `http://backend:3000`

### Running the Production Environment

1. Build and start the production environment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Access the application:
   - Frontend: http://localhost
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3000

## Development Workflow

SafetyPin follows a GitFlow-inspired branching strategy:

1. `main` - production-ready code
2. `develop` - integration branch for new features
3. Feature branches - named as `feature/feature-name`
4. Bugfix branches - named as `bugfix/issue-description`

### Current Development Priorities

Current development priorities (as of March 2025) are:

1. Implementing the service layer for authentication (User, Auth, SSO, MFA services)
2. Defining and implementing API endpoints for core functionality
3. Implementing cloud integration services (AWS/Azure/GCP)
4. Developing frontend authentication components

If you'd like to contribute, please focus on these areas. See the [Project Todos](./docs/project-todos.md) file for the most up-to-date list of tasks.

## User Flow

1. User registers and logs into the application
2. User creates a new SFTP connection with security and lifecycle settings
3. System provisions an ephemeral SFTP server connected to an S3 bucket
4. User shares connection details with clients
5. Clients connect to the SFTP server using standard SFTP tools
6. Files are transferred to/from the S3 bucket
7. User monitors transfer activity through the dashboard
8. Server is terminated based on lifecycle settings

## Edition-Specific Features

SafetyPin uses a feature flag system to control which features are available in different editions of the application. This allows the same codebase to be used for both OSS and commercial editions.

### Feature Flag Implementation

Feature flags are managed through a configuration system that:

1. Reads edition type from environment variables
2. Controls feature availability based on edition
3. Provides utility functions to check feature availability

Example usage:
```typescript
import { isFeatureEnabled } from '../config/features';

if (isFeatureEnabled('billing.subscription')) {
  // Commercial edition code
} else {
  // OSS edition code
}
```

See the [Feature Flags Documentation](./docs/feature-flags.md) for more information.

## Troubleshooting

### Running with Docker Compose
- If you make changes to Docker configuration, rebuild with `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build`
- Check Docker logs for errors: `docker-compose logs backend` or `docker-compose logs frontend`
- Ensure the database is properly initialized: `docker-compose logs postgres`

### Running Without Docker (Local Development)
- If you're experiencing issues with the frontend connecting to the API, check the API Test page at `/api-test`
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running and accessible with the credentials specified in your .env file
- The backend API server runs on port 3000, frontend on port 3001 by default

### TypeScript Type Safety
- When working with error handling, remember to properly type check `unknown` error types
- Use type guards to safely access properties
- When using API methods that require `Record<string, unknown>`, you may need to cast custom interfaces
- Run `npm run type-check` regularly to catch type issues before they cause runtime problems
