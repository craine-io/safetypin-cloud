# Database Prerequisites for Enterprise SSO Implementation

## Database Schema Design
- [ ] Design authentication-related database tables/collections
  - [ ] Users table with fields for SSO identifiers
  - [ ] Identity providers configuration table
  - [ ] MFA methods and settings table
  - [ ] User sessions table
  - [ ] Authentication audit logs table
  - [ ] Role-based access control tables
  - [ ] Organization/tenant tables for multi-tenant support

## Database Setup and Configuration
- [ ] Choose appropriate database technology for auth data (consider compliance requirements)
- [ ] Set up development database environment
- [ ] Configure database encryption for sensitive authentication data
- [ ] Implement database backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Set up proper database user permissions for auth services

## Database Migration Strategy
- [ ] Create database migration scripts for schema creation
- [ ] Develop strategy for migrating existing user accounts
- [ ] Plan for data consistency during migration
- [ ] Create rollback plans for database changes

## Data Access Layer Implementation
- [ ] Define data models/entities for authentication objects
- [ ] Create repository interfaces for authentication data access
- [ ] Implement repository classes with database-specific code
- [ ] Develop data access services for authentication components
- [ ] Create caching strategy for frequently accessed auth data

## Identity Management Foundations
- [ ] Implement user identity storage with support for multiple identity sources
- [ ] Create data structures for mapping external IDs to internal user IDs
- [ ] Design tenant/organization data model for multi-tenant SSO
- [ ] Implement role and permission storage for authorization

## Session Management Infrastructure
- [ ] Design session storage schema for tracking active sessions
- [ ] Implement token blacklist/revocation storage
- [ ] Create data structures for MFA session state tracking
- [ ] Design schema for tracking device/browser authentication states

## Audit and Compliance Data Storage
- [ ] Design comprehensive audit logging schema for authentication events

- [ ] Design test cases for authentication data access

## Security Hardening
- [ ] Implement password hashing for local authentication
- [ ] Set up encryption for sensitive credentials storage
- [ ] Configure database connection security
- [ ] Implement protection against injection attacks

## Documentation
- [ ] Document database schema with entity relationship diagrams
- [ ] Create data dictionary for authentication tables/collections
- [ ] Document database security measures
- [ ] Create developer guides for working with authentication data

## DevOps Considerations
- [ ] Set up database continuous integration/deployment
- [ ] Create scripts for database initialization in new environments
- [ ] Implement database monitoring for authentication services
- [ ] Develop health checks for database connectivity
