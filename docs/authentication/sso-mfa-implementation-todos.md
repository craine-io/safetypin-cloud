# SafetyPin OSS Enterprise SSO with MFA Implementation To-Do List

## Research & Planning Phase
- [ ] Review existing authentication codebase in SafetyPin frontend
- [ ] Research HIPAA compliance requirements for authentication in healthcare
- [ ] Evaluate major SSO providers (Okta, Auth0, Azure AD, AWS Cognito)
- [ ] Define specific MFA methods to support (TOTP, SMS, push notifications)
- [ ] Document authentication flow diagrams for SSO integration
- [ ] Create security policy document for authentication requirements

## Frontend Implementation
- [ ] Create AuthContext updates to support SSO providers
- [ ] Implement SSO login button components
- [ ] Design SSO configuration UI for admin panel
- [ ] Implement MFA enrollment screens
- [ ] Create MFA challenge screens for different methods (TOTP, SMS)
- [ ] Develop session timeout notifications
- [ ] Implement secure token storage in frontend

## Backend Implementation
- [ ] Create/update authentication API endpoints
- [ ] Implement SAML 2.0 authentication flow
- [ ] Implement OIDC authentication flow
- [ ] Design and implement multi-tenant SSO configurations
- [ ] Create JWT token handling with proper validation
- [ ] Implement MFA verification logic
- [ ] Set up secure session management

## HIPAA Compliance Features
- [ ] Implement comprehensive authentication audit logging
- [ ] Add IP address restrictions capability
- [ ] Create automatic session termination after inactivity
- [ ] Implement account lockout after failed attempts
- [ ] Add forced password rotation for non-SSO authentication
- [ ] Create emergency access controls for authorized administrators
- [ ] Implement role-based access controls for PHI data

## Testing Tasks
- [ ] Create automated tests for SSO authentication flows
- [ ] Test MFA enrollment and verification processes
- [ ] Verify session management and timeout functionality
- [ ] Test integration with major identity providers
- [ ] Perform security testing on authentication endpoints
- [ ] Validate proper audit logging for HIPAA compliance
- [ ] Test fallback authentication mechanisms

## Documentation
- [ ] Create SSO setup guides for major identity providers
- [ ] Document MFA configuration options
- [ ] Create HIPAA compliance documentation for authentication
- [ ] Update API documentation for authentication endpoints
- [ ] Create user guides for MFA enrollment and usage
- [ ] Document security best practices for administrators

## Deployment & Operations
- [ ] Create database migration scripts for new authentication tables
- [ ] Develop rollout strategy for existing users
- [ ] Create monitoring dashboards for authentication services
- [ ] Implement alerting for suspicious authentication activities
- [ ] Create backup and recovery procedures for authentication data
- [ ] Prepare deployment automation scripts

## Additional Considerations
- [ ] Plan for integration with existing enterprise directories (LDAP/AD)
- [ ] Consider future biometric authentication support
- [ ] Research emerging authentication standards for future compatibility
- [ ] Plan for internationalization of authentication UI
- [ ] Consider accessibility requirements for authentication screens
