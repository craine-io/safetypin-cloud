# SafetyPin Implementation Notes

## Server and Transfer API Implementation (2025-03-28)

### Database Layer
1. Added database schema for servers and transfers
   - Created the `servers` table to store SFTP server metadata
   - Created the `server_credentials` table to store SSH keys securely
   - Created the `transfers` table to track file transfer history
   - Implemented appropriate indices for performance optimization

2. Created repository layer
   - Implemented `ServerRepository` interface and Postgres implementation
   - Implemented `TransferRepository` interface and Postgres implementation
   - Extended repository factory to support new repositories
   - Added seed data for development testing

### API Layer
1. Implemented RESTful API controllers and endpoints
   - Created `ServerController` for server CRUD operations
   - Created `TransferController` for transfer tracking and statistics
   - Added comprehensive error handling in controllers

2. Integrated controllers with Express server
   - Added routes for server and transfer management
   - Ensured proper request and response formats

### Frontend Integration
1. Updated frontend services to use the real API
   - Modified `servers.ts` service to call real API endpoints with mock data fallback
   - Modified `transfers.ts` service to call real API endpoints with mock data fallback
   - Added data mapping helpers to convert backend DTOs to frontend models
   - Implemented error handling with graceful fallback to mock data

2. Maintained backward compatibility
   - Kept existing mock data available for development and testing
   - Ensured frontend works when backend is unavailable
   - Used consistent data formats between mock and real API

## Next Steps

1. Service Layer Implementation
   - Create dedicated service classes for server and transfer management
   - Move business logic from controllers to service layer
   - Implement request validation and data transformation

2. Authentication Integration
   - Secure API endpoints with authentication middleware
   - Implement organization-specific data access
   - Add permission checks for sensitive operations

3. Cloud Provider Integration
   - Implement AWS S3 integration for file storage
   - Integrate with AWS Transfer Family for SFTP server provisioning
   - Create provider-agnostic interfaces for future multi-cloud support

## Technical Decisions

### Fallback Strategy
We've implemented a graceful fallback strategy where the frontend attempts to call the real API but falls back to mock data if the API is unavailable or returns an error. This approach has several advantages:

1. Development can continue even if the backend is offline
2. Frontend components can be tested with consistent mock data
3. Users get a better experience (with mock data) instead of error screens when backend issues occur

### Data Mapping
The backend and frontend use slightly different data models, so we've implemented mapping functions to convert between them:

1. Backend uses raw database models with snake_case properties
2. Frontend uses camelCase properties and includes formatted values (e.g., human-readable file sizes)
3. Mapping happens at the service layer in the frontend

### Error Handling
We've implemented comprehensive error handling at multiple levels:

1. Backend controllers catch and log exceptions, returning appropriate HTTP status codes
2. Frontend services catch API errors and fall back to mock data when possible
3. UI components handle null or undefined data gracefully
