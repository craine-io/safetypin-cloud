## Troubleshooting Notes

### Running the Frontend and Backend with Docker Compose

- Use the provided script to start all containerized services:
  - Windows: Run `docker-up.bat` from the project root
  - Linux/Mac: Run `./docker-up.sh` from the project root
- The containerized services will be available at:
  - Backend API: http://localhost:3000
  - Frontend UI: http://localhost:3001
  - PostgreSQL: localhost:5432
- When running in Docker, the frontend communicates with the backend using the internal Docker service name: `http://backend:3000`
- If you make changes to Docker configuration, rebuild with `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build`

### Running Without Docker (Local Development)

- The backend API server runs on port 3000 by default
- The frontend development server should run on port 3001
- To start the frontend on the correct port, either:
  - Use the script: `npm run start:alt` which sets PORT=3001
  - Manually set PORT: `set PORT=3001 && npm start` (Windows) or `PORT=3001 npm start` (Linux/Mac)
- If you're experiencing issues with the frontend connecting to the API, check the API Test page at `/api-test`

### TypeScript Type Safety

- When working with error handling, remember to properly type check `unknown` error types
- Use type guards (e.g., `typeof err === 'object' && err !== null && 'property' in err`) to safely access properties
- When using API methods that require `Record<string, unknown>`, you may need to cast custom interfaces using `as unknown as Record<string, unknown>`
- Run `npm run type-check` regularly to catch type issues before they cause runtime problems
