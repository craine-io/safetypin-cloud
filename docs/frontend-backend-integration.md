# Frontend-Backend Integration Guide

This document outlines the changes made to integrate the SafetyPin frontend with the backend PostgreSQL database data.

## Issues Addressed

1. Frontend was using hardcoded mock data instead of fetching from the backend API
2. TypeScript errors in error handling code
3. Docker network configuration issues (frontend couldn't reach backend)
4. Dashboard component was using hardcoded data
5. API testing improvements needed for better debugging

## Changes Made

### 1. Server List Component Update
- Replaced hardcoded mock data with the `useServers` hook
- Added proper loading and error state handling
- Implemented proper delete functionality with API integration

### 2. Dashboard Component Update
- Updated to use the `useServers` hook instead of hardcoded data
- Added loading and error states
- Modified property references to match database schema

### 3. Server Service Improvements
- Enhanced error handling with proper TypeScript type checking
- Improved data mapping between database format and UI needs
- More selective about when to fall back to mock data
- Added better logging for debugging

### 4. API Service Improvements
- Enhanced error logging for easier debugging
- Modified mock data configuration to respect environment variables
- Added detailed error information for easier troubleshooting

### 5. Docker Configuration
- Updated Docker configuration to use the backend service name for internal access
- Modified frontend environment variables to properly connect to backend in Docker
- Updated API tests to support better diagnostics

### 6. APITest Component Improvements
- Added direct API tests using fetch
- Created debug servers endpoint test
- Improved error handling and display
- Enhanced environment information display

## Testing Steps

After making these changes, you should test the integration using these steps:

1. Start the Docker environment with `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up`
2. Access the frontend at http://localhost:3001
3. Navigate to the API Test page to verify connectivity
4. Check the Servers page to confirm real database data is displayed
5. Check the Dashboard to confirm it shows real server data
6. Try creating, editing, and deleting servers to verify API operations

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. Check browser console for detailed error messages
2. Use the API Test page to diagnose connectivity issues
3. Check Docker logs for both frontend and backend containers
4. Verify database migrations have run successfully
5. Confirm the backend /debug/servers endpoint returns data when called directly

## Docker Network Considerations

- When running in Docker, the frontend must use `http://backend:3000` to reach the backend
- When accessing the frontend from a browser, API calls will go through the Docker network
- The `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable in docker-compose.dev.yml sets this configuration

## Mock Data Fallback

The system is configured to use real API data by default, but will fall back to mock data if:

1. The environment variable `REACT_APP_USE_MOCK_DATA` is set to 'true'
2. The API is completely unreachable (network error)

This design ensures a good development experience while still pushing for real data use.
